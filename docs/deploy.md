# Enki Production Deployment

This guide covers deploying Enki to production. The system has three hosts that
talk to three databases plus a one-shot CLI for tenant provisioning.

> **Initial deployment scope.** This document targets a direct-host deployment
> with each host terminating HTTPS itself — no reverse proxy. If a proxy
> (NGINX, IIS-ARR, AppGW, ALB) is added later, see the
> [Adding a reverse proxy](#appendix-adding-a-reverse-proxy) appendix at the end.

| Host | Port (dev) | Database(s) it owns |
|---|---|---|
| `SDI.Enki.Identity` | 5196 / 7300 | `Enki_Identity` (ASP.NET Identity + OpenIddict) |
| `SDI.Enki.WebApi` | 5107 / 7302 | `Enki_Master` + per-tenant pair, accessed via `ITenantDbContextFactory` |
| `SDI.Enki.BlazorServer` | 5073 / 7301 | none — talks to Identity + WebApi over HTTPS |
| `SDI.Enki.Migrator` | n/a (CLI) | applies migrations to any of the above |

---

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 10 runtime** — `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` 10.0.x on the host machine.
- **SQL Server 2019+** — local instance or remote. Account needs `dbcreator` for
  first-run migrate; thereafter `db_owner` per database is enough.
- **Identity signing certificate** — a PFX containing the cert + private key
  used to sign OIDC tokens. Doesn't need to be public-CA; can be self-signed.
- **Syncfusion Blazor license key** — required by the BlazorServer host
  (community license is fine for non-commercial; commercial needs a paid key).
- **License signing private key** — RSA private key (PEM) used by
  `HeimdallLicenseFileGenerator` to sign customer `.lic` files. Dev keys live
  at `dev-keys/private.pem` — production must use a fresh key kept out of source.

---

## Configuration matrix

Every host reads its config from `appsettings.json` + `appsettings.Production.json`
+ environment variables (last wins). For production-sensitive keys, prefer
**environment variables** or a secret store; the appsettings files should ship
with placeholders.

### Identity host (`SDI.Enki.Identity`)

| Key | Required (Prod) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ConnectionStrings:Identity` | yes | `Server=<host>;Database=Enki_Identity;...` |
| `Identity:SigningCertificate:Path` | yes | Filesystem path to the OIDC token-signing PFX |
| `Identity:SigningCertificate:Password` | only if PFX is password-protected | Read once at startup |
| `Identity:ClientSecret` | yes | Shared secret with the BlazorServer client. Rotate by updating both ends |
| `OpenTelemetry:Otlp:Endpoint` | optional | If set, traces export here instead of the console |
| `AuditRetention:AuthEventLogDays` | optional | Default 90 (high-volume + PII-laden) |
| `AuditRetention:IdentityAuditLogDays` | optional | Default 365 |
| `AuditRetention:RunAtUtcHour` | optional | Default 03 |
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS` | recommended | `https://+:7300` (or whatever bind) |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` | yes | `Production` |
| `Serilog:WriteTo` | optional | If unset, falls back to console + 14-day rolling file |

Each `Identity:*` key has an explicit fail-fast guard in `Program.cs` —
missing config aborts startup with a clear message rather than booting in a
broken state.

### WebApi host (`SDI.Enki.WebApi`)

| Key | Required (Prod) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ConnectionStrings:Master` | yes | `Server=<host>;Database=Enki_Master;...` |
| `ConnectionStrings:TenantTemplate` | yes | Connection-string template used by `ITenantDbContextFactory` to assemble per-tenant strings; `{Database}` placeholder gets substituted |
| `Identity:Issuer` | yes | Must exactly match Identity's resolved issuer (e.g. `https://identity.enki.example/`) |
| `Licensing:PrivateKeyPath` | yes | Filesystem path to the RSA private-key PEM. **Do not** point this at `dev-keys/` in production |
| `RateLimit:ExpensiveRequestsPerMinute` | optional | Default 5; tune based on tenant-provisioning workload |
| `OpenTelemetry:Otlp:Endpoint` | optional | If set, traces export here instead of the console |
| `AuditRetention:MasterAuditLogDays` | optional | Default 365 |
| `AuditRetention:TenantAuditLogDays` | optional | Default 730 |
| `AuditRetention:RunAtUtcHour` | optional | Default 03 |
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS` | recommended | `https://+:7302` |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` | yes | `Production` |

### BlazorServer host (`SDI.Enki.BlazorServer`)

| Key | Required (Prod) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Identity:Authority` | yes | OIDC discovery URL (e.g. `https://identity.enki.example/`) |
| `Identity:ClientId` | optional | Default `enki-blazor` |
| `Identity:ClientSecret` | yes | Must match the Identity host's `Identity:ClientSecret` |
| `WebApi:BaseAddress` | yes | e.g. `https://api.enki.example/` |
| `Syncfusion:LicenseKey` | yes | Configured-fail-fast in production |
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS` | recommended | `https://+:7301` |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` | yes | `Production` |

The BlazorServer host's cookie `Secure` flag is set to `Always` in non-Development
environments; HTTPS is therefore mandatory.

### Environment-variable form

ASP.NET maps colon to double-underscore in env vars:

```
Identity__Authority=https://identity.enki.example/
ConnectionStrings__Master=Server=...;Database=Enki_Master;...
Syncfusion__LicenseKey=<key>
```

---

## Database migrations + first-time bootstrap

**Hosts no longer self-migrate or self-seed in any environment** (see
[plan-migrator-bootstrap.md](plan-migrator-bootstrap.md), SDI-ENG-PLAN-002).
The Migrator CLI is the single bootstrap path.

### First-time deploy of a new environment

One command stages everything:

```powershell
# Required environment variables (no dev fallback in any environment):
$env:ConnectionStrings__Master            = 'Server=...;Database=Enki_Master;...'
$env:ConnectionStrings__Identity          = 'Server=...;Database=Enki_Identity;...'
$env:Identity__Seed__BlazorClientSecret   = '<must match BlazorServer pool Identity__ClientSecret>'
$env:Identity__Seed__AdminEmail           = 'admin@your-org.example'
$env:Identity__Seed__AdminPassword        = '<strong password — change after first sign-in>'
$env:Identity__Seed__BlazorBaseUri        = 'https://dev.sdiamr.com/'   # required outside Dev

dotnet run --project src/SDI.Enki.Migrator -- bootstrap-environment
```

What it does, idempotent:

1. Apply EF migrations to the **Identity DB** (OpenIddict + AspNet* + AuthEventLog + IdentityAuditLog).
2. Apply EF migrations to the **Master DB** (Tenants, Users, Tools, Licenses, MasterAuditLog).
3. Run the canonical Tools / Calibrations seed (no-op once the rows exist).
4. Create the OpenIddict `enki-blazor` client + `enki` scope (create-only — re-runs preserve a rotated client secret).
5. Create one Enki-admin Team-Office user from the supplied email + password (re-runs reconcile `IsEnkiAdmin=true` but never reset the password).

After the command exits 0, start the IIS app pools. Verify sign-in
works **before** closing the deploy session — the admin password is
single-tracked.

### Rolling deploys (schema-only updates)

For deploys that change schema but don't add new admins:

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/SDI.Enki.Migrator -- migrate-all
```

…runs `migrate-identity`, `migrate-master`, and `migrate-tenants` in
order. Each step is idempotent and stops the chain on first failure.

For tenant-DB-only updates: `migrate-tenants [--all | --tenants A,B] [--parallel N]`.

### Per-tenant DBs

Provisioned on demand via the WebApi `POST /tenants` endpoint (gated
by `CanProvisionTenants` — Supervisor+ or admin). The Migrator
doesn't auto-provision tenants in any non-Dev environment.

---

## Health probes

Every host exposes **anonymous** health endpoints suitable for load-balancer
liveness / readiness checks.

| Path | Returns | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | 200 if everything healthy, 503 otherwise | Smoke / monitoring |
| `/health/live` | 200 if process is up | Liveness — restart on red |
| `/health/ready` | 200 if dependencies (DB, etc.) healthy | Readiness — drain on red |

- **Identity** ready check probes `Enki_Identity` connectivity.
- **WebApi** ready check probes `Enki_Master` connectivity.
- **BlazorServer** ready check is self-only — Blazor can serve the login page
  even if upstreams are momentarily degraded; failing-ready on upstream blip
  would cycle the pod for transient outages that don't affect this host.

Per-tenant database connectivity is intentionally **not** part of WebApi's
`/health/ready` — a single tenant's DB being down should not drain WebApi
traffic for the rest of the fleet. Track per-tenant health separately.

---

## HTTPS contract

- All three hosts terminate HTTPS directly. `UseHttpsRedirection()` runs in
  non-Development; HSTS is on for the BlazorServer host.
- Cookie `Secure` flag is `Always` outside Development — HTTP requests can't
  carry the auth cookie.
- The `Identity:Authority` value must match exactly across BlazorServer's OIDC
  client config and WebApi's `Identity:Issuer`. If the Identity host is reachable
  via multiple hostnames, pick one and use it consistently. Mismatches surface
  as 401s on every WebApi call.

---

## Defense-in-depth headers

All three hosts emit:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
X-XSS-Protection: 0
```

HSTS is added by the BlazorServer host's `UseHsts()` middleware in non-Development.

---

## Operational tasks

### Provisioning a tenant

Once the master DB is migrated, a Supervisor (or `enki-admin`) posts to
`POST /tenants` (via the BlazorServer Tenants admin page). The endpoint
is gated by `CanProvisionTenants`. The WebApi:

1. Creates `Enki_<CODE>_Active` and `Enki_<CODE>_Archive` databases.
2. Applies the tenant-DB migrations to both.
3. Inserts `Tenant` + `TenantDatabase` rows in master.
4. Returns the new tenant's id + active connection string.

### Generating a license

A Supervisor, an admin, or any Office user holding the `Licensing`
capability claim navigates to `/licenses/new` in the Blazor portal
(gated by `CanManageLicensing`). The wizard collects tools,
calibrations, features, and an operator-supplied license key (GUID), then asks
the WebApi to mint a `.lic` file via `HeimdallLicenseFileGenerator` (which
signs with the RSA key at `Licensing:PrivateKeyPath`). The customer downloads
both the `.lic` and a sidecar `key.txt` containing the licensee + GUID.

### Audit retention

Audit tables (`AuditLog` per tenant, `MasterAuditLog`, `IdentityAuditLog`,
`AuthEventLog`) are append-only. Automated daily prune is built in:

- **Identity host** runs `AuditRetentionService` — prunes `AuthEventLog`
  + `IdentityAuditLog`.
- **WebApi host** runs `MasterAuditRetentionService` (master DB) +
  `TenantAuditRetentionService` (fans out across every active tenant
  and prunes per-tenant `AuditLog`).

All four use a one-minute wake cycle and fire once per UTC day at the
configured hour (default 03:00 — typical low-traffic window). Default
retention windows:

| Table | Default days | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthEventLog`     | 90  | High volume + PII-laden |
| `IdentityAuditLog` | 365 | Admin actions, lower volume |
| `MasterAuditLog`   | 365 | Cross-tenant ops events |
| per-tenant `AuditLog` | 730 | Drilling ops history holds business value longer |

Tunable via the `AuditRetention` config section. Set any `*Days` to `0`
(or negative) to disable that table's prune — useful when a regulatory
window demands indefinite retention. Failures isolate per tenant on the
fan-out sweep — one bad tenant doesn't stop the rest.

### Password reset

`AdminUsersController.ResetPassword` returns a temporary password in the API
response body for the admin to read off the screen and hand to the user
out-of-band. There is **no** email delivery; document this in your support
runbook. (Adding email is on the post-launch backlog.)

---

## Logging

Each host writes structured logs via Serilog:

- **Console** sink — always on.
- **Rolling file** sink — `logs/<host>-.log` with daily rotation, 14 days
  retention.

Override via `Serilog:WriteTo` in config to redirect to Seq / OTLP / wherever.

The WebApi host enriches every request with an `X-Request-Id` header (echoed
back to clients) and pushes that id into the log scope so structured queries
can stitch a single request across log lines.

---

## Secret staging

### Approach

Enki configures itself through ASP.NET Core's standard `IConfiguration`
provider chain. In production the order is (later overrides earlier):

1. `appsettings.json` — non-secret defaults shipped with the build.
2. `appsettings.{Environment}.json` — non-secret per-environment overrides.
3. **Environment variables** — the production secret source. ASP.NET
   maps double-underscore to colon, so config key `ConnectionStrings:Master`
   is set via env var `ConnectionStrings__Master`. No special prefix is
   used (Enki relies on the .NET default provider).
4. Command-line arguments — operational overrides.

**No secret value is ever committed to a repository file.** The
`appsettings.*.json` files are templates with placeholder values; the
real secrets live in environment variables on the host.

### Phase 1: SDI-hosted (current)

Enki runs on SDI's own servers behind SDI's firewall. Every required
secret is set as an environment variable on the host before the .NET
process launches. No vault product is in use.

How to set them, by host platform:

- **Windows Service** — register the service with a wrapping launcher
  script that calls
  `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ConfigKey", "value", "Machine")`
  before `Start-Process`. Or set the service's environment block
  directly via `nssm` / a custom service installer.
- **systemd** — add `EnvironmentFile=/etc/enki/secrets.env` to the unit
  file; the file is `chmod 600 root:root`.
- **IIS** — set application-pool environment variables via
  `appcmd set apppool "..." /+environmentVariables.[name='ConfigKey',value='...']`.
- **Docker / Compose** — `-e ConfigKey=value` or `environment:` block;
  source values from the orchestrator's secret primitive.

ASP.NET maps colon to double-underscore in env vars: configuration key
`ConnectionStrings:Master` becomes env var `ConnectionStrings__Master`.

### Phase 2: customer-hosted (future)

When Enki is deployed to a customer's infrastructure, the customer's IT
may prefer to source secrets from their own tooling — HashiCorp Vault,
on-prem KMS, encrypted-secrets-in-git, or just environment variables
like SDI uses. Enki itself ships no dependency on any specific secret
store; the customer plugs their preferred provider into the standard
`IConfiguration` chain at deploy time by editing their fork's
`Program.cs` (or by patching it through their deployment pipeline).

The shape is one line per provider, e.g.:

```csharp
// In each host's Program.cs, after the default chain:
// AddEnvironmentVariables() with no prefix is already wired by
// WebApplication.CreateBuilder — no explicit call needed.

// Customer's own provider — added by the customer's deploy team:
// builder.Configuration.AddVaultConfigurationProvider(...);
// builder.Configuration.AddYourCorporateKmsProvider(...);
```

The customer carries the dependency on their tooling. SDI's build
remains clean. If customer demand consolidates around one or two
patterns, SDI may add a partial-class `ApplyCustomerProviders` hook to
make this extension cleaner; until then, fork-and-patch is acceptable.

### Secret inventory

The complete list of secrets each host requires. The env-var name is
the production source-of-truth; `appsettings.Production.json` should
not contain any of these values.

| Configuration key | Env-var name | Required by | What it secures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ConnectionStrings:Master` | `ConnectionStrings__Master` | WebApi, Migrator | Master DB connection (tenants registry, master Users, Tools, Licenses, audit) |
| `ConnectionStrings:Identity` | `ConnectionStrings__Identity` | Identity, Migrator | Identity DB connection (AspNet*, OpenIddict, audit feeds) |
| `Identity:SigningCertificate:Path` | `Identity__SigningCertificate__Path` | Identity | Path to the OIDC signing/encryption PFX on disk |
| `Identity:SigningCertificate:Password` | `Identity__SigningCertificate__Password` | Identity | OIDC PFX password |
| `Identity:Seed:DefaultUserPassword` | `Identity__Seed__DefaultUserPassword` | Identity (Development only) | Initial password for seeded dev users. **Must NOT be set in non-Development.** Production users go through admin-create with a unique temporary password. |
| `Identity:Seed:BlazorClientSecret` | `Identity__Seed__BlazorClientSecret` | Identity, BlazorServer | OIDC client secret shared by both ends of the auth-code flow. Must match across both hosts. |
| `Syncfusion:LicenseKey` | `Syncfusion__LicenseKey` | BlazorServer | Syncfusion runtime licence key |
| `Licensing:PrivateKeyPath` | `Licensing__PrivateKeyPath` | WebApi | Path to the RSA private-key PEM used to sign `.lic` files |

### Startup validation

In any non-Development environment, each host validates at startup that
every required secret in the inventory is present. A missing secret
produces a fail-loud startup exception with the missing key name in the
message. The host does not start.

This guarantees that:

- A misconfigured deploy is caught immediately, not after the first
  user request fails in a confusing way.
- A production host can never silently fall through to a dev fallback
  (in particular, `Identity:Seed:DefaultUserPassword` is rejected as a
  source of password material in non-Development).

### Don'ts

- **Never commit a real secret to `appsettings.*.json`.** The committed
  files are templates with placeholder values only.
- **Never log a secret value.** The Serilog destructuring policy scrubs
  `Authorization`, `password`, `key`, `secret`, `token` substrings;
  changes to that policy require explicit review.
- **Never set `Identity:Seed:DefaultUserPassword` in non-Development.**
  It exists for the dev seeder; the startup validation above rejects
  it in any production environment.
- **Never share an env-var file across customer deployments.** Every
  customer's deployment gets its own freshly-generated set of secrets.

## First-time deploy checklist

- [ ] SQL Server reachable; service account has `dbcreator`
- [ ] Identity signing PFX staged; `Identity:SigningCertificate:Path` set
- [ ] License RSA private-key PEM staged; `Licensing:PrivateKeyPath` set
- [ ] App pool identities have **traverse + read** on every parent directory
      down to the PFX and PEM (see § IIS app pool gotchas below)
- [ ] Syncfusion license key set (`Syncfusion:LicenseKey`)
- [ ] OIDC `ClientSecret` set on **both** Identity + BlazorServer (matching values)
- [ ] `Identity:Authority` and `Identity:Issuer` agree across hosts
- [ ] `WebApi:BaseAddress` points at the WebApi's external URL
- [ ] Migrator CLI applied: Identity DB, Master DB
- [ ] All three `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production`
- [ ] HTTPS bindings up on all three hosts
- [ ] `/health/live` returns 200 on every host
- [ ] `/health/ready` returns 200 on Identity + WebApi
- [ ] Sign in via the Blazor portal; verify token issuance lands in the
      `AuthEventLog` table
- [ ] Provision a test tenant via the admin UI; verify the Active + Archive
      databases come up green

## IIS app pool gotchas

Notes from the first staging deploy onto IIS — gotchas that aren't obvious
from a clean reading of the code or the .NET docs but cost a few hours to
diagnose if you trip them.

### "The system cannot find the file specified" loading the OIDC PFX

Symptom: the Identity host crashes at startup with HTTP 500.30 and the
event log shows:

```
System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: The system cannot
find the file specified.
   at System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509CertificateLoader.ImportPfx(...)
   at System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509CertificateLoader.LoadPkcs12FromFile(...)
   at Program.<>c__DisplayClass0_0.<<Main>$>b__4(OpenIddictServerBuilder options)
```

Cause: the `LoadPkcs12FromFile` call defaults to
`X509KeyStorageFlags.DefaultKeySet`, which tries to persist the
private key into the **running user's profile** key container.
IIS app pool virtual accounts (`IIS APPPOOL\<sitename>`) don't have a
profile loaded by default, so the persist step fails — and the
CryptoAPI returns `FILE_NOT_FOUND`. The error names the *key container*,
not the PFX, but the message doesn't make that distinction.

Two fixes; either suffices:

- **Code-level (current head):** [`src/SDI.Enki.Identity/Program.cs`](../src/SDI.Enki.Identity/Program.cs)
  loads the PFX with `MachineKeySet | EphemeralKeySet` so the private
  key never touches a key container — works on any IIS pool config.
- **Operational fallback (older builds, or if you ever drop the flag):**
  enable Load User Profile on the pool:

  ```powershell
  Set-ItemProperty IIS:\AppPools\<pool> -Name processModel.loadUserProfile -Value $true
  Restart-WebAppPool -Name '<pool>'
  ```

### Traverse permissions on parent directories

IIS app pool virtual accounts aren't members of `Users` by default. If
you stage secrets under `C:\Enki\<env>\` or similar, the pool needs
**Read+Execute** on every parent directory down to the file — not just
Read on the file. Without traverse on the parent, Windows reports
`FILE_NOT_FOUND` (not `ACCESS_DENIED`).

```powershell
# Recursive Read+Execute for both pool identities; (OI)(CI) makes it inheritable.
icacls 'C:\Enki' /grant 'IIS APPPOOL\<identity-pool>:(OI)(CI)RX' /T
icacls 'C:\Enki' /grant 'IIS APPPOOL\<webapi-pool>:(OI)(CI)RX' /T
```

### `dotnet publish` may skip the Web Deploy step silently

`dotnet publish -c Release -p:PublishProfile=<profile>` against an
MSDeploy-shaped `.pubxml` sometimes does a folder publish only and never
invokes MSDeploy. The build "succeeded" output is identical either way.
If the deploy didn't actually push, hitting any URL on the IIS site
returns 404 or `Default IIS Page` instead of your app.

Force the deploy step explicitly:

```powershell
dotnet publish src/<project> -c Release `
    -p:DeployOnBuild=true `
    -p:PublishProfile="<profile-name>" `
    -p:Password=$pubPwd
```

The added `-p:DeployOnBuild=true` triggers the full Web Publish
pipeline. Look for `Adding file (...)` and `Updating sitemanifest`
log lines — those confirm MSDeploy is actually pushing.

### WMSVC self-signed cert

If WMSVC on the deploy target uses its default self-signed cert (CN
matching the machine name, not your `dev-*.<domain>` hostname),
Web Deploy from a remote dev box fails SSL validation. Add to each
publish profile:

```xml
<AllowUntrustedCertificate>true</AllowUntrustedCertificate>
```

…or replace the WMSVC binding with a cert covering your hostnames.

---

## Known gaps

These are documented now so they don't surprise the first ops team to take
this on. None blocks initial deployment.

- **No CSP header.** The Razor login pages + Blazor Server's SignalR bootstrap
  use inline scripts; a useful Content-Security-Policy needs nonces or a
  hash allowlist. Deferred until a WAF / reverse proxy lands.
- **No password-reset email.** Admin reads the temp password off the screen
  and hands it off out-of-band. Email delivery is on the next-iteration
  backlog.
- **Per-tenant DB health probes** are not part of `/health/ready`. Track
  separately.

---

## Appendix: Adding a reverse proxy

If a reverse proxy (NGINX, IIS-ARR, AppGW, ALB) goes in front of any of these
hosts later, three things change:

1. **Wire `UseForwardedHeaders()`** in each host's `Program.cs`, before
   `UseHttpsRedirection()` and `UseAuthentication()`:

   ```csharp
   app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions
   {
       ForwardedHeaders = ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedFor | ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto,
   });
   ```

   Without this, the rate limiter buckets every request into one IP, the
   `AuthEventLog` records the proxy IP not the client, and the cookie `Secure`
   detection mis-fires when the proxy terminates HTTPS.

2. **Trust posture.** Add a config-driven allow-list of trusted proxy IPs
   (e.g. `ReverseProxy:KnownProxies`) and populate `KnownProxies` from it.
   Default .NET trusts loopback only, which is rarely the right answer in
   prod.

3. **Proxy config (NGINX example):**

   ```nginx
   location / {
